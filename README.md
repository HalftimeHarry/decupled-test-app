Example how to run the Apache Web Server in Gitpod.io
Try or Contribute
open https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/gitpod-io/apache-example

What this Example does
use the Dockerfile to install Apache via apt-get, because in the Dockerfile we have root access
configure Apache via apache.conf and apache.env.sh from the Gitpod workspace
have a minimal Apache config in apache.conf
run Apache as gitpod:gitpod
follow the Apache logs in the Gitpod Terminal View via multitail
run apache on port 8080, because as unpreviliged process it can't open port 80
Terminal Commands to try
apachectl start - start Apache Web Server (it's started automatically on workspace launch)
apachectl stop - stop Apache Web Server
gp open /var/log/apache2/access.log - Open Apache access.log in Gitpod editor
gp open /var/log/apache2/error.log - Open Apache error.log in Gitpod editor
multitail /var/log/apache2/access.log -I /var/log/apache2/error.log - View and follow logs in Terminal
